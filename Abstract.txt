VULN-SCAN is a vulnerability-scanning web application that identifies security flaws  
and vulnerabilities in networks, and applications. This Vulnerability scanner is an  
automation tool that scans for security issues, misconfigurations, and software  
vulnerabilities, providing organizations with critical insights to address and  
mitigate them. The scanner scans for ports, URLs, and XSS attacks to prevent  
security attacks. Port scanning assesses network security, identifies open ports,  
and discovers services running on them. URL scanning is essential for web  
application security testing, using manual and automated techniques.
